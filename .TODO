- so redis holds the token for the given amount of time and once the token expires it expires from redis
so instead of me adding tokens to the database it keeps track of itself

- on redis u save the refresh token with the same max life you gave it when you assigned it
- same the refresh token and the max life of it should match the max life given to the refresh token

Jwt tokens
Refreshing tokens
Mongodb for users data
